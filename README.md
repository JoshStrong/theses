## MSc Data Science; UCL: ___Model Agnostic Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Deep Learning___.

My master’s thesis focused on Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to solve few-shot deep learning problems. To this
end, I conducted a thorough literature review on deep learning and meta-learning. This was followed by research on
literature relating to MAML and MAML++. The project involved implementing two experimental studies using Python; a
toy problem demonstrating the effectiveness of MAML in addition to implementing MAML on a computer vision problem

## BSc Mathematics; University of York: ___Cox’s Proportional Hazards Model Applied to Loan Book Data___.

Complete independent and thorough study of statistical regression model Cox’s Proportional Hazard Model with an atypical
application to hundreds of thousands of financial peer-to-peer loan book data points, to gain an understanding in the rate of
loan default over time for different cohorts of borrowers. The project was supported by examples and graphical data
visualisations using programming language R.
